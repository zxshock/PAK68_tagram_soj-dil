# PAK68_tagram_soj-dil
Adapter for the hard to obtain TAG-RAMs used on PAK68/3 speeders for Atari ST computers from DIL to SOJ  

See "soj-dil_protos.png" on how to solder them ... basically use precision pin rows, cut some pins short and solder them SMD-style while others can be used through hole, solder chip on top.  
About suitable chips. You'll have to check on that on your own.  
These were actually the first PCBs I ever had produced ... hence the embarassing spacer for the name left behind by Eagle in the final PCBs.
